# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Predicting the trip duration of bikes rental in other to Improve the Intelligent Transport System](https://github.com/emani27/Emani_DataScience/blob/master/Linear_Regression%20Project.ipynb)

<img src="images/bike_image.jpg"/>

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib where use to clean up and graph the data
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Determining whether a client will subscribe a term deposit or not using a logistic classifier](https://github.com/emani27/Emani_DataScience/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression%20Project.ipynb)

<img src="images/breast-cancer.jpeg?raw=true"/>

- Used logistic regression to explore and make note of attributes information 
- Use data cleaning principles to get rid of the unwanted data
- Explore data with groupby function and analyzing it
- Used Logistic regression classifier to improve on the data to make better prediction on whether the client will subcribe or not
- Explored a machine learning approach to predict by using Sklearn numeric

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](/sample_page)

<img src="images/knee-brace-ortho.png?raw=true"/>

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

[Handwriting classification and recognition of numbers using Neural Networks]

- Used Keras-Based to import the mnist data into your colab environment
- Explore the data descriptive and class distribution
- Use data preparation to normalize the pixel value of all images and the differences between pre-processed images and the normalized images 
- Evaluate the models by using Kfolds and validate its accuracy
- Summarize its diagnostics by using matplotlib to know the Cross Entropy Loss and Classification Accuracy
